## Setting up settings ⌨️
Welcome to this directory containing my preferences, extensions and stylization of my visual studio code interface.
Use the contents of the **"user-settings.json"** file to add it to your present in **CMD + Shift + P** (Command palette) > User settings.
You can obviously modify each parameter by changing its value associated with the variable just before and if you are not really familiar with the code in .json,
you can use the classic parameters interface and the modified parameters will be highlighted in blue. I let you put the extensions that you want but if you want mine send me an private message on one of my social media. Thanks !
